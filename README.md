ChromeStrap
===========

Google Chrome extension that displays a popup window showing the current Bootstrap 3 breakpoint when resizing your browser window.

This was mainly for my own personal use but if other people find it useful then that's just dandy!

Installation
============

Feel free to download this repository and add it as an unpacked extension with Google Chrome. Alternatively, I've put it in the Chrome web store here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromestrap/dlfjcpgdebmdmlcljfpbpmkdipdmkcof
